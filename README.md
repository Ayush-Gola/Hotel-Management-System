> 🔐 A menu-driven, multi-role Java application for managing hotel rooms, bookings, and users via the command-line interface.

---

## 📌 Description

The **Hotel Management System** is a Java-based console application that allows three different user roles:

- 👨‍💼 **Admin**
- 🧑‍🔧 **Resource Manager**
- 👤 **Regular User**

Each role has specific capabilities like adding/editing rooms, managing users, booking/canceling rooms, and viewing bookings. The application demonstrates core Java principles including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections (ArrayList, Iterator)
- Menu-driven design
- Modular service layers
- Input validation and exception handling

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Principles in Action

| 🧩 Principle     | ✅ Where it's Applied                                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** |Private fields in Booking, User, Resource, etc., with public getters/setters      |
| **Abstraction**   | Business logic is hidden inside service classes like BookingService, UserService |
| **Modularity**    |Clear separation between Entity, Service, Repository (DatabaseClass), and UI layer|
| **Inheritance**   |  Can be extended in future (e.g., base User class for Admin, RegularUser, etc.)  |
| **Polymorphism**  | Potential use via method overriding or interfaces for resource or user actions   |
